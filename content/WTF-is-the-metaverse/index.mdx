What is the Metaverse?

The idea of the Metaverse is fuzzy and debated. Some see it as a whole new reality, others a hyped-up Zoom.

"Meta" itself means different things: beyond, self-referential, and in this case, the name of a company. Just like "meta," the Metaverse definition is not universally agreed upon.

Here's a simpler take: the Metaverse is just a digital world with humans in it. This includes games, social media, and online marketplaces – anything with interaction, rules, and a digital presence.

Twitter, for example, is already a Metaverse. It has users interacting, content rules, and a digital space. Adding 3D wouldn't make it more of a Metaverse.

The internet is constantly evolving, and the next step might be spatial computing – think interacting with the web in 3D spaces. This is what excites people about the Metaverse, but the hype might be overblown.

Remember the VR boom of 2015? It didn't quite deliver on its promises. The Metaverse might be repackaged VR, a way to justify expensive VR headsets. It feels like Meta is trying to dominate the hardware of this "next big thing," just like Apple with phones and Microsoft with computers.

The truth is, we already live in a bunch of overlapping Metaverses. Discord, Fortnite, Twitter, LinkedIn – they all have their own rules, economies, and interactions. They're Metaverses already, without needing extra dimensions.

Even the work from home setups might be a kind of "Office Metaverse" with all the digital tools working together. Microsoft, with its Flight Simulator tech, could be a major player in building these connected workspaces.

Some argue humans aren't meant to stare at screens all day. But strapping VR headsets on 24/7 isn't exactly the answer. Nausea is a real problem that will limit VR adoption.

A more interesting Metaverse concept might involve using cameras and powerful computers to transform physical spaces into digital worlds. It's expensive, but potentially more appealing than VR goggles.

Here's the exciting part: the Metaverse, in this broader sense, could become a whole new kind of digital economy with unique behaviors. Each existing Metaverse (game, social media platform) already has its own mechanics, rules, and leaders.

Creators in these online spaces are already building new economies, rewarded with social capital today and potentially with digital tokens tomorrow. Users, by paying attention, contribute to this social capital, which could transform into real financial rewards. These digital economies will have their own dynamics, assets, and rules, completely separate from the physical world. This lack of existing rules is both exciting and challenging – we'll have to make them up as we go.

Advances in computing will allow for even more complex and engaging Metaverses. The architects of these worlds will hold immense influence, like leaders of countries.

The Metaverse isn't some future utopia accessed through VR headsets. It's already here, in the many digital spaces we inhabit. As these spaces evolve and connect, they'll create something entirely new and fascinating, with or without an extra dimension.
