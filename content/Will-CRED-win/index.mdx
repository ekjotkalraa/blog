Kunal Shah, after co-founding FreeCharge, a successful mobile recharge platform, set his sights on a new venture: CRED. While FreeCharge catered to budget-conscious young professionals, CRED targets a different segment - affluent young Indians with high credit scores.

Both platforms share a core idea: offering benefits for a specific customer action. FreeCharge gave discounts for mobile recharges, while CRED rewards timely credit card bill payments with "coins" redeemable for various benefits.

Comparing the two reveals how the same model has been adapted to a vastly different market.

The inception of CRED marked a crucial juncture in Shah's journey. Despite opportunities to stay on as a senior figure within respected venture capital firms, he opted to immerse himself in the Indian startup ecosystem in 2018, mirroring the trajectory of FreeCharge.

His new vision was straightforward: to curate a "gated community" of trusted individuals and furnish them with top-tier benefits.

While many firms were targeting the 'next billion internet users,' Shah recognized the untapped potential within the existing internet-connected population.

Here's how CRED caters to a premium audience:

Exclusivity: Only individuals with a credit score above 750 can join, creating a sense of aspiration and "fear of missing out" (FOMO).

Focus on High-Value Users: CRED prioritizes users with a history of responsible credit behavior, believing they offer a higher lifetime value compared to a wider user base.

Superior Experience: CRED boasts a user-friendly app and curated offers that improve with increased usage.

CRED's initial success stemmed from its unique proposition and a seamless user experience. However, despite positive user reviews, the company has faced challenges:

Despite humorous advertisements, first-mover advantage, and a supreme app experience coupled with aspirational elements, CRED has expended over $850 million without effectively capitalizing on the market it created, thereby paving the way for competitors like Slice, OneCard, and others who now thrive in this industry.

Navigating a challenging path ahead, Kunal and his team possess the potential to forge ahead, leveraging regular and unique USPs alongside innovative offerings such as CRED UPI, while cultivating a loyal customer base.
